# Array methods

A package to loop through containers (mostly arrays) and execute things.

Examples of methods are: Filter, Map, etc.

# Help needed

For now, I use many functions with self-explanatory names, but I'd like to fake generics in order to make just one `Filter` function instead of `FilterInts`, `FilterStrings`, etc.

Go does not support generics to allow for simplicity in implementation.
